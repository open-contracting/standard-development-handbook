# The schema

`release-schema.json` is the Single Source of Truth (SSOT) for defining OCDS' objects and fields. It is documented using an extended version of [JSON Schema draft 4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-04) (see below).

The source for `release-schema.json` and other schema files is in the [`standard` repository](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard) in the [standard/standard/schema directory](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/tree/HEAD/standard/schema).

These schema files are processed during the [documentation build](technical/build) and [deployment process](technical/deployment) to replace `{lang}` and `{version}` tokens.

## Forward and backwards compatibility

The standard's documentation contains a [deprecation policy](http://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/schema/deprecation/) and a description of its approach to [semantic versioning](http://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/support/governance/#versions).

## Our extensions to JSON Schema

We add to JSON Schema the properties `codelist`, `openCodelist`, `deprecated`, `omitWhenMerged`, `wholeListMerge`, and `versionId`, documented in the [Open Standards for Data](http://os4d.opendataservices.coop/development/schema/#extended-json-schema) handbook and defined in a [metaschema patch](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/tree/HEAD/standard/schema/metaschema).
