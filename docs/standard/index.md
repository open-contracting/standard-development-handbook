# Standard

The Open Contracting Data Standard includes a **technical specification** made up of:

* An extended JSON Schema that defines objects and fields for describing a contracting process
* A set of codelists that define standard values for several fields
* A set of rules for constructing identifiers for contracting processes and organizations
* A set of rules for merging individual 'releases' into a consolidated 'record' of a contracting process
* A set of rules for transforming between JSON and tabular serializations
* An extension mechanism for describing additional fields

This section describes the processes for maintaining these assets. See the [Normative and non-normative policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xjlAneqgewZvHh6_hwuQ98hbjxRcA2IUqOTJiNGcOf8/edit) for details on which sections of the documentation are normative or not.
