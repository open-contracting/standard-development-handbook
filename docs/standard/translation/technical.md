# Technical processes for translation

This page documents the technical steps to push and pull translations from Transifex and to build translated schema, codelists and documentation.

You should only perform these tasks once the source files are frozen, after having completed [Schemas and extensions](../../technical/deployment#schemas-and-extensions) in the deployment process.

## Configure Transifex

### Credentials

The first time you use Transifex, create a [`~/.transifexrc` file](https://docs.transifex.com/client/client-configuration#~/-transifexrc) (replace `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD`):

```shell
sphinx-intl create-transifexrc --transifex-username USERNAME --transifex-password PASSWORD
```

### Projects

For new major and minor versions:

* [Create a Transifex project](https://www.transifex.com/OpenDataServices/), named e.g. `open-contracting-standard-1-1`
* Update `TRANSIFEX_PROJECT` in `include/config.mk` with the name of the Transifex project

## Extract strings to translate into POT files

Whenever documentation pages, codelist CSV files or JSON Schema files are changed, you must extract strings to translate from these files into POT files:

```shell
make extract
```

If only documentation pages are changed, you may run:

```shell
make extract_markdown
```

If only codelist files:

```shell
make extract_codelists
```

If only schema files:

```shell
make extract_schema
```

## Map POT files to Transifex resources

Whenever documentation pages, codelist CSV files or JSON Schema files are renamed, added or removed, you must create the POT files as above, empty the [`.tx/config` file](https://docs.transifex.com/client/client-configuration#-tx/config) (`make clean_txconfig`) and update the `.tx/config` file (`make update_txconfig`). In short, run:

```shell
make extract clean_txconfig update_txconfig
```

## Push strings to translate to Transifex

To push POT files, run `tx push -s`. To both extract strings and push resources, run:

```shell
make push
```

To push specific resources (replace the Transifex project name), run e.g.:

```shell
tx push -s -r open-contracting-standard-1-1.codelists open-contracting-standard-1-1.schema
```

## Pull translations from Transifex

To forcefully pull *supported* translations, run `make pull` or `tx pull -f -l es,fr`

To forcefully pull *specific* translations, run e.g. `make pull.es` or `tx pull -f -l es`

To forcefully pull *all* translations, run `tx pull -f -a`

Then, build the documentation with the new translations.

## Push translations to Transifex

If text is translated locally by editing PO or POT files, the translations can be pushed to Transifex, [*after building the documentation*](../technical/build). **This will overwrite any new translations made on Transifex since the last time they were pulled.** Run `make force_push_all` or `tx push -s -t -f -l es,fr --no-interactive`

After pushing, check that the translation progress on Transifex is minimally affected. To avoid losing translations made on Transifex, pull translations before applying your changes, re-building the documentation and pushing new translations. If you made a mistake, checkout a clean branch of the standard, re-build the documentation and push old translations.

## Test translations

Pull requests are built and accessible at `http://standard.open-contracting.org/BRANCH/`. Translations of Markdown pages using Sphinx directives should be checked in particular:

* `es/getting_started/` uses `jsoninclude`
* `es/schema/reference/` uses `jsonschema`
* `es/schema/release/` has a Docson widget
* `es/schema/codelists/` uses `csv-table-no-translate`
* `es/extensions/` uses `extensionselectortable`
* `es/extensions/bids/` uses `extensiontable`
* `es/extensions/party_details/` uses `extensionlist`

## Review translated codelists

Translated codelists are stored in language directories under `build/codelists` during the build process. To stack a list of CSV files for review, you can do:

```bash
for i in *.csv; do printf "\n\n$i,,,\n\n"; cat $i; done > ../all_codelists.csv
```

## Add a community translation

Once all strings are translated and reviewed in Transifex, and all warnings or issues on Transifex are resolved:

1. Checkout the live branch, e.g. `git checkout 1.1`
1. Checkout a new branch, e.g. `git checkout -b 1.1-italian`
1. Add the locale code to `TRANSLATIONS` in `include/config.mk`
1. Pull the locale's translations, e.g. `tx pull -f -l it`
1. Update the `language_options` block in `standard/docs/en/_templates/layout.html`
1. Create a pull request for the community translation
1. [Test the translations on the build of the pull request](#test-translations)
1. Check the `localization-note` appears on the homepage
1. Merge the new branch onto the live branch
1. [Build and deploy](../../technical/deployment#build-and-deploy), remembering to update `robots.txt`
