# Understanding Transifex

Translators use Transifex to translate the strings in the standard's schema, codelist and documentation files from the source language (English) to other languages.

## Projects and resources

Transifex is organized into projects:

* [OCDS 1.0](https://www.transifex.com/OpenDataServices/open-contracting-standard-1-0/dashboard/)
* [OCDS 1.1](https://www.transifex.com/OpenDataServices/open-contracting-standard-1-1/dashboard/)
* [OCDS Extension Explorer](https://www.transifex.com/OpenDataServices/ocds-extension-explorer/dashboard/)
* [OCDS Extensions](https://www.transifex.com/OpenDataServices/ocds-extensions/dashboard/)
* [OCDS for PPPs](https://www.transifex.com/OpenDataServices/ocds-for-ppps/dashboard/)
* [Standard Theme](https://www.transifex.com/OpenDataServices/open-contracting-standard-theme/dashboard/): strings from the documentation theme
* [CoVE](https://www.transifex.com/OpenDataServices/cove/dashboard/): strings from the OCDS Data Review Tool

Projects contain [resources](https://www.transifex.com/OpenDataServices/open-contracting-standard-1-1/content/), which contain strings to be translated. Here, we discuss only Standard 1.0 and Standard 1.1.

## Strings to be translated

### From Markdown files

With the exceptions of the `schema` and `codelists` resources, each resource sources its strings to be translated from a single Markdown (`.md`) documentation file in the [`standard/docs/en`](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/tree/HEAD/standard/docs/en) directory tree. These files provide the content for <http://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/>.

For example, the resource [`getting_started--contracting_process`](https://www.transifex.com/OpenDataServices/open-contracting-standard-1-1/translate/#es/getting_started--contracting_process/111787219) sources strings from [`standard/docs/en/getting_started/contracting_process.md`](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/blob/HEAD/standard/docs/en/getting_started/contracting_process.md) and provides the content for <http://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/es/getting_started/contracting_process/>.

### From CSV and JSON files

For the [`codelists`](https://www.transifex.com/OpenDataServices/open-contracting-standard-1-1/translate/#es/codelists/76986036) resource, the strings to be translated are extracted from the CSV files in [`standard/schema/codelists/*.csv`](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/tree/HEAD/standard/schema/codelists) and [`standard/docs/en/extensions/codelists/*.csv`](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/tree/HEAD/standard/docs/en/extensions/codelists). The translated CSV files are not distributed with the documentation ([standard#673](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/issues/673)). They provide the content for: 

* codelist tables on the [codelists](http://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/es/schema/codelists/) and [building blocks](http://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/es/getting_started/building_blocks/) pages
* codelist tables on extensions pages like [bids](http://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/es/extensions/bids/)

For the [`schema`](https://www.transifex.com/OpenDataServices/open-contracting-standard-1-1/translate/#es/schema/76882756) resource, the strings to be translated are extracted from the JSON files in [`standard/schema`](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard/tree/HEAD/standard/schema). They provide the content for:

* JSON Schema tables on the [release reference](http://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/es/schema/reference/) and [records reference](http://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/es/schema/records_reference/) pages
* schema viewers on the [release](http://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/es/schema/release/), [release package](http://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/es/schema/release_package/) and [record package](http://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/es/schema/record_package/) schema pages
* translated JSON Schema files distributed with the documentation
