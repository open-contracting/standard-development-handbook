Standard
========

The Open Contracting Data Standard includes a **technical specification** made up of:

-  An extended JSON Schema that defines objects and fields for describing a contracting process
-  A set of codelists that define standard values for several fields
-  A set of rules for constructing identifiers for contracting processes and organizations
-  A set of rules for merging individual 'releases' into a consolidated 'record' of a contracting process
-  A set of rules for transforming between JSON and tabular serializations
-  An extension mechanism for describing additional fields

This section describes the processes for maintaining these assets. See the `Normative and non-normative policy <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xjlAneqgewZvHh6_hwuQ98hbjxRcA2IUqOTJiNGcOf8/edit>`__ for details on which sections of the documentation are normative or not.

Documentation is written in Markdown syntax with `recommonmark <https://recommonmark.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__ building on `Commonmark <https://commonmark.org/>`__.
