# Notifications

For CRM-related notifications, see the [CRM's wiki](https://crm.open-contracting.org/projects/ocds/wiki/Alert_settings). Otherwise:

* GitHub issue activity notifies all repository watchers and all issue subscribers. (Same for pull requests.) The GitHub accounts of many Open Data Services developers are configured to automatically watch new repositories.
* Travis, by default, notifies the email address of the committer of the last commit about the build's success or failure.
* [UptimeRobot](http://uptimerobot.com/) and Icinga2 (for the [servers](servers)) notify Ben Webb and David Spencer.
* [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/) (for the OCDS Data Review Tool) notifies all Open Data Services developers via individual accounts.
* As described under [GitHub integrations](../github/integrations), Travis cron jobs send notifications.

Emails sent to code@opendataservices.coop are delivered to all Open Data Services developers.
