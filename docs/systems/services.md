# Administrative access

See the [Deploy documentation](https://ocdsdeploy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/index.html) for access to self-hosted services and to third-party monitoring services.

## Airtable

There should be at most two [Owners](https://airtable.com/wspXFnEMMAgLMWfe0/workspace/billing). All users should belong to the above organizations.

## Amazon Web Services

See [Identity and Access Management](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#/home) for a list of users and permissions. We use S3 (Simple Storage Service) and SES (Simple Email Service).

## GitHub

The staff of the above organizations may be [members](https://github.com/orgs/open-contracting/people) of the [open-contracting](https://github.com/open-contracting) GitHub organization.

There should be at most two members with the [Owner](https://help.github.com/articles/permission-levels-for-an-organization/) role from each organization.

## Google

### Admin

There should be a minimum of [Super Admin](https://admin.google.com/open-contracting.org/AdminHome?hl=en#DomainSettings/notab=1&role=9170516996784129&subtab=roles) users from OCP, and no other assigned admins.

*Less secure apps* is set to "Allow users to manage their access to less secure apps" for the open-contracting.org domain, and [*Allow less secure apps*](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps) is set to "ON" for the data@open-contracting.org user, so that Redmine can fetch mail.

### Analytics

There should be at most two [users](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/a35677147w162037252p163071392/admin/suiteusermanagement/account) with all permissions from OCP. There should be at most two users with the Read & Analyze permissions from each other organization.

### Cloud Platform

For the `ocds` project, [IAM](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam?organizationId=1015889055088&project=ocds-172716) should only include Google-managed service accounts, `ods-crm-redmine-backup` and `sysadmin@dogsbody.com`. [Service accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts?organizationId=1015889055088&project=ocds-172716) should only include default service accounts and `ods-crm-redmine-backup`. It should only use two storage buckets (`crm-open-contracting-org-daily-backups` and `crm-open-contracting-org-weekly-backups`). `sysadmin@dogsbody.com` must have the ["Storage Admin" role](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/iam-roles) (`roles/storage.admin`), to get the `storage.buckets.list` permission.

Periodically review [all projects](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-resource-manager?organizationId=1015889055088). To view a project's history, click its [Activity tab](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/activity?organizationId=1015889055088&project=ocds-172716). To view a project's resources, click its [Dashboard tab](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?organizationId=1015889055088&project=ocds-172716). Projects include:

* Library (two storage buckets)
* Toucan
* Website Search (API key)

In case a new user needs to be given admin access to the `ocds` project, you can run, for example:

    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ocds-172716 --member user:jmckinney@open-contracting.org --role roles/owner
