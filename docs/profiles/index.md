# Profiles

Profiles are adaptations of OCDS to suit the disclosure requirements and user needs of a particular sector, type of contracting process and/or legal framework.

Profiles typically bring together a number of extensions to meet these requirements and, in some rare cases, can also make fundamental changes to the OCDS schema which would not be permitted in an extension.

Profiles are built to their own documentation micro-sites which may include:

* Patched schema
* A mapping between the disclosure requirements and/or legal framework and the schema
* Worked examples
* Introductory material
* Implementation guidance

Profiles are, in many ways, similar to the [standard](../standard) itself. Differences are noted on these pages.

New profiles can be created using [this template](https://github.com/open-contracting/standard_profile_template).
